## Documentation Standards

Each feature document follows this structure:
- **Overview** - What the feature does and why it exists
- **Architecture** - How it's structured and organized
- **Implementation** - Technical details and code organization
- **Usage** - How to use and integrate with the feature
- **Customization** - How to modify and extend the feature
- **Dependencies** - What other features/libraries it relies on
- **Testing** - How to test the feature
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Getting Started

1. Start with [App Architecture](./01-app-architecture.md) to understand the overall structure

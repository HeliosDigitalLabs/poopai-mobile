# No Poop Detected Error Screen Implementation

## Overview

When a user scans a photo that doesn't contain poop, the frontend now shows a dedicated error screen ("No Poop Detected") instead of the Results screen.

## Implementation Details

### Detection Logic

- The backend returns `bristolType: 0` and `poopSummary: "Image does not appear to contain poop."` when no poop is detected
- The frontend checks for this specific condition in `CameraScreen.tsx` after analysis

### Screen Components

- **NoPoopDetectedScreen**: Located at `/screens/analysis/NoPoopDetectedScreen.tsx`
- Shows the user's photo as background with dark overlay for readability
- Features animated PoopBot character with floating animations
- Displays error message in a chat bubble from PoopBot
- Includes helpful tips for better photos in a blue tips section
- Provides buttons to "Try Again" (go to camera) or "Go Home"

### PoopBot Animation Features

- **Floating Animation**: PoopBot gently floats up/down and left/right
- **Rotation Animation**: Subtle rotation for liveliness
- **Chat Bubble**: Pulsating speech bubble with error message
- **Consistent Branding**: Same PoopBot character used throughout the app

### Navigation Flow

1. User takes a photo in CameraScreen
2. Photo is analyzed via `analyzeImage()`
3. If `bristolType === 0` and specific poop summary detected:
   - Navigate to `NoPoopDetected` screen with photo
4. Otherwise:
   - Navigate to `Results` screen as normal

## Testing

### Development Mode Testing

To test the "no poop detected" screen in development mode:

1. **Method 1: Config Flag**

   - Set `AppConfig.mockData.forceNoPoopDetected = true` in `config/app.config.ts`
   - All scans will show the error screen

2. **Method 2: Random Testing**

   - Uncomment the random logic in `services/analysis/analysisService.ts` in `getMockAnalysis()`
   - 20% of scans will show the error screen

3. **Method 3: Manual Return**
   - In `getMockAnalysis()`, directly return `MOCK_NO_POOP_RESPONSE`

### Production Testing

- Use the actual backend with images that don't contain poop
- The server will return the appropriate response triggering the error screen

## Files Modified

- `/screens/analysis/NoPoopDetectedScreen.tsx` (created)
- `/screens/camera/CameraScreen.tsx` (updated analysis logic)
- `/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` (added screen to stacks)
- `/types/navigation.ts` (added route definition)
- `/services/analysis/analysisService.ts` (added mock responses)
- `/config/app.config.ts` (added testing flag)

## Key Features

- **Animated PoopBot Character**: Floating, rotating PoopBot with personality
- **Interactive Chat Bubble**: PoopBot speaks to the user with friendly error messaging
- **Photo Background**: Shows what was scanned with dark overlay for readability
- **Helpful Tips Section**: Blue highlighted tips for better photo-taking
- **Clear Call-to-Action Buttons**: "Try Again" and "Go Home" with intuitive icons
- **Consistent UI/UX**: Matches app design language and branding
- **Easy Development Testing**: Config flag for quick testing during development
- **Smooth Animations**: Multiple layered animations for engaging user experience
